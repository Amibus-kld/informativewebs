    <h1>Step 2</h1>
      <h2>4. Get a steady simmer.

        After adding the rice, the temperature of your water will drop significantly, and it'll stop boiling. Let it come back to a gentle simmer (otherwise you run the risk of your water cooking off faster than your rice gets tender).
        <br><hr>
        5. Don't take off the lid. 
        
        Cover the saucepan and reduce heat to low. Though it will be tempting, keep the lid on! It's very important not to mess with the steam. </h2>
