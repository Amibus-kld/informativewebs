      <h2>3. Bring the water to a boil

        Then, stir in your rice and salt. And if you want to add a tab of butter, too, go for it â€” your rice will taste 10x better.
        <br><hr>
        4. Get a steady simmer.
        
        After adding the rice, the temperature of your water will drop significantly, and it'll stop boiling. Let it come back to a gentle simmer (otherwise you run the risk of your water cooking off faster than your rice gets tender).
        <br><hr>
        5. Don't take off the lid. 
        <br><hr>
        Cover the saucepan and reduce heat to low. Though it will be tempting, keep the lid on! It's very important not to mess with the steam. 
        
        6. Check at 18 minutes. 
        <Br><hr>
        For long grain white rice, I always set a timer for 18, knowing that it could need another minute or two. Let the rice be your indicator, not the water. If there's a little water leftover, it's totally fine! Just tilt the saucepan slightly to drain it out. (Cooking brown rice? Check at 30 minutes.)
        <br><hr>
        7. Leave it alone. 
        
        Turn off the heat, replace the lid, and let it rest for a few minutes in the steamy saucepan. Patience is a virtue, my friend. 
        <Br><hr>
        8. Fluff it up!
        
        Use a fork to gently mix and lift rice to make sure that the grains don't stick together. 
        
        If you have a rice cooker, the game is a lot easier. Use the same magic ratio and throw everything into the rice cooker, which does all the work for you. When the machine says it's ready, the same "leave it alone" and fluffing instructions apply.  </h2>
