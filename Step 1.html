          <h1>Step 1</h1>
          <h2>1. Rinse the rice.

            Ugh, I know, rinsing is annoying, but it really is worth it to get rid of the dusty starches that may make the rice too sticky. Just place your rice in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold water until the water runs clear.
            <br><hr>
            2. Remember the ratio. 
            
            For most types of rice, you'll always use a ratio of 1 cup rice to 2 cups water, which you can scale up or down. (Double-check your rice packaging to be sure.) Feel free to swap in chicken or vegetable broth for more flavor.
            <br><hr>
            3. Bring the water to a boil
            
            Then, stir in your rice and salt. And if you want to add a tab of butter, too, go for it â€” your rice will taste 10x better.</h2>
